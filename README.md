## Getting Started

### Step 1 — Create a Yandex OAuth App

You need a Yandex OAuth application to authorize the server to access your Webmaster data. This is a one-time setup.

1. Open [https://oauth.yandex.ru/client/new](https://oauth.yandex.ru/client/new) in your browser
2. Fill in **App name** — for example, `Webmaster MCP`
3. Under **Platforms**, select **Web services**
4. In the **Callback URI** field, enter exactly: `https://oauth.yandex.ru`
5. Under **Access**, expand **Yandex.Webmaster** and enable these two scopes:
   - `webmaster:hostinfo`
   - `webmaster:verify`
6. Click **Create app**
7. Copy the **CLIENT_ID** shown on the next page — you'll need it in Step 4

> **Alternative:** If you already have a Yandex Webmaster OAuth token, you can skip OAuth entirely by setting `YANDEX_WEBMASTER_API_KEY` in your MCP config's `env` block. See the [Environment Variables Reference](#environment-variables-reference) section below.

---

### Step 2 — Install uv

This server runs via `uvx`, which is part of the [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager. You do not need to clone this repository — `uvx` fetches and runs it directly from GitHub.

**macOS / Linux**

Run these three commands in your terminal:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

The installer places the `uv` and `uvx` binaries in `$HOME/.local/bin`. You need to make your shell aware of them for the current session:

```bash
source $HOME/.local/bin/env
```

To make this permanent so future terminal windows also have `uvx` available, add the source line to your shell config:

```bash
echo 'source $HOME/.local/bin/env' >> ~/.zshrc
```

> **Why all three commands?** The `curl` command installs uv but does not modify your current shell session. The `source` command activates it right now. The `echo` command ensures it is available every time you open a new terminal. Skipping either of the last two means you will see `command not found: uvx` in your terminal or in AI client logs.

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Restart your terminal after installation.

**Verify the installation**

```bash
uv --version
```

You should see output like `uv 0.5.x`. If you see `command not found`, see the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section.

---

### Step 3 — Configure your AI Client

#### Claude Code

Add the server to your project or global MCP settings. Run the following from your project directory or home directory:

```bash
claude mcp add ywm --command "uvx" --args "--from,git+https://github.com/skharitonov/mcp-ywm,ywm-mcp"
```

> The comma-separated `--args` format above is equivalent to the JSON array form `["--from", "git+https://github.com/skharitonov/mcp-ywm", "ywm-mcp"]` shown in the JSON config below.

Or edit `~/.claude/settings.json` directly and add an entry under `mcpServers`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ywm": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/skharitonov/mcp-ywm", "ywm-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop launches as a GUI application and does not inherit your shell's `PATH`. This means the bare `uvx` command will not be found — you must use the **full absolute path** to the `uvx` binary.

First, find the full path:

- **macOS / Linux:** run `which uvx` in your terminal — it will print something like `/Users/yourname/.local/bin/uvx`
- **Windows:** run `(Get-Command uvx).Source` in PowerShell — it will print something like `C:\Users\yourname\.local\bin\uvx.exe`

Then open the Claude Desktop config file:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

Add the following, replacing the `uvx` path with the full path you found above:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ywm": {
      "command": "/Users/yourname/.local/bin/uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/skharitonov/mcp-ywm", "ywm-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

After saving the config file, **fully quit the app** (on macOS: `Cmd+Q`, not just closing the window) and reopen it. Claude Desktop only reads the config at startup.

---

### Step 4 — Authenticate

Once the server is configured, open Claude and run the authentication flow. Start by asking for setup instructions:

```
Call setup_oauth_app
```

The server will return the exact steps for creating a Yandex OAuth app (same as Step 1 above, in case you need a reminder). Then start the authorization flow with the `client_id` you copied:

```
Call start_auth with client_id "YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE"
```

The server will display a URL and a short code. Open the URL in your browser, enter the code, and approve access. The server polls in the background and saves the token automatically once you approve.

The token is stored at:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/yandex-webmaster-mcp/token.json`
- **Linux:** `~/.config/yandex-webmaster-mcp/token.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\yandex-webmaster-mcp\token.json`

> **Override the storage location:** Set `YANDEX_WEBMASTER_TOKEN_DIR` in the MCP config's `env` block to store the token in a custom directory. This is useful for shared environments or CI systems.

After the browser approval, you will see: `Authentication successful! Token saved to: <path>`. You are now ready to use all tools.

---

### Step 5 — Test

Ask Claude these two questions to confirm everything is working:

```
Get my Yandex Webmaster user ID
```

```
List all my Yandex Webmaster sites
```

If both return data, the server is set up correctly. Note the `user_id` from the first response — you will need it for site-specific queries.

---

## Sample Prompts

| Category | Sample Prompt |
|----------|--------------|
| Setup | "Walk me through creating a Yandex OAuth app for Webmaster" |
| Sites | "List all my sites in Yandex Webmaster" |
| Sites | "Add https://example.com to my Yandex Webmaster account" |
| Search — queries | "Show me the top 20 search queries for example.com in the last 30 days" |
| Search — trends | "How has my click-through rate changed week by week over the past 3 months?" |
| Search — pages | "Which pages from my site are currently showing up in Yandex search?" |
| Indexing / recrawl | "I just updated 5 pages — submit them all for immediate recrawling" |
| Sitemaps | "Check whether my sitemap at https://example.com/sitemap.xml has been accepted" |
| Diagnostics — problems | "Are there any critical errors Yandex has detected on my site?" |
| Diagnostics — links | "Find all broken internal links on my site" |
| Diagnostics — backlinks | "Show me which external sites are linking to example.com" |

---

## host_id Format

Yandex Webmaster identifies sites using a `host_id` — a colon-separated string derived from the site URL. The `get_hosts` tool returns `host_id` values for all your sites.

| Site URL | host_id |
|----------|---------|
| `https://example.com` | `https:example.com:443` |
| `http://example.com` | `http:example.com:80` |
| `https://www.example.com` | `https:www.example.com:443` |
| `https://example.com:8443` | `https:example.com:8443` |

When you pass a `host_id` to any tool, URL-encoding (e.g. `https%3Aexample.com%3A443`) is handled automatically — you provide the plain colon-separated form.

---

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `YANDEX_WEBMASTER_API_KEY` | No | — | A Yandex OAuth token. Set this to skip the `start_auth` flow entirely. Useful for CI or shared environments where running an interactive browser flow is not practical. |
| `YANDEX_WEBMASTER_TOKEN_DIR` | No | Platform config dir | Directory where `token.json` is stored after `start_auth`. Override when you want to control exactly where the token lives. |

To pass environment variables to the server, add an `env` block to your MCP config entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ywm": {
      "command": "/Users/yourname/.local/bin/uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "git+https://github.com/skharitonov/mcp-ywm", "ywm-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "YANDEX_WEBMASTER_API_KEY": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **macOS/Linux:** Use the full uvx path from `which uvx` (typically `/Users/yourname/.local/bin/uvx` on macOS or `/home/yourname/.local/bin/uvx` on Linux)  
> **Windows:** Use the full uvx path from `(Get-Command uvx).Source` (typically `C:\Users\yourname\.local\bin\uvx.exe`)

---

## Troubleshooting

**`spawn uvx ENOENT` or `command not found: uvx`**

Claude Desktop cannot find `uvx` because GUI apps do not inherit your shell's `PATH`. Use the full absolute path to the binary. Find it by running `which uvx` (macOS/Linux) or `(Get-Command uvx).Source` (Windows), then update your config to use that full path instead of just `uvx`.

---

**`uv --version` returns "command not found" right after installing**

The installer modified `~/.local/bin/env` but has not updated your current shell session. Run:

```bash
source $HOME/.local/bin/env
```

Then try `uv --version` again. To avoid this in future sessions, add the source line to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`.

---

**"Token not found" or "Run start_auth first"**

Two ways to fix this:

1. Call `start_auth` with your `client_id` to run the browser auth flow and save a token automatically.
2. If you already have a token, set `YANDEX_WEBMASTER_API_KEY` in the `env` block of your MCP config — the server will use it directly without needing a token file.

---

**"Authorization timed out"**

The browser approval window is 5 minutes. If you did not approve in time, simply call `start_auth` again to get a fresh code.

---

**API returns 403 or "wrong scopes" error**

Your Yandex OAuth app was created without the required permissions. Go to [https://oauth.yandex.ru](https://oauth.yandex.ru), delete the existing app, and create a new one with both `webmaster:hostinfo` and `webmaster:verify` scopes enabled under Yandex.Webmaster. Then run `start_auth` again with the new `client_id`.

---

**`host_id` format errors**

Use the colon-separated format returned by `get_hosts`. Common mistakes:

| Wrong | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| `https://example.com` | `https:example.com:443` |
| `example.com` | `https:example.com:443` |
| `https:example.com` | `https:example.com:443` |

The port number is required. Use `443` for HTTPS and `80` for HTTP unless your site runs on a non-standard port.

---

**Config changes not taking effect**

Claude Desktop only reads its config file at startup. After editing the config, fully quit the app — on macOS use `Cmd+Q` (closing the window is not enough), on Windows right-click the tray icon and choose Quit — then reopen it.
